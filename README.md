# Ada Pets
This repository goes along with the [Creating APIs](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/blob/master/09-intermediate-rails/creating-apis.md) curriculum.

This repository will be used to track our favorite pets. The `master` branch contains an initial `Pets` controller as well as a `Pet` model. Take a look at these to get you started. There is also one `index` route, and a basic controller implementation for that route.
